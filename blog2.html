                   Mandala Art
                </h1>

                <p>
                    If you've ever visited a Buddhist temple or admired religious art from Asia, you've likely seen mandalas. These complex works of art combine geometric patterns, religious symbolism, and layers of meaning to create a masterpiece that acts as a symbol, prayer, meditation exercise, and holy blessing all in one. The name, mandala, comes from the Sanskrit word for circle and refers to the sense of wholeness created by both circular forms. In Tibet, the mandala is called Khyil-khor, which refers to the center of all creation where a truly awakened being lives, taking the meaning further than the Sanskrit reference.<br>

                    In Buddhism, mandalas represent the ideal form of the universe. The act of creating a mandala represents the transformation of the universe from a reality of suffering to one of enlightenment. While Tibetan Buddhists see the center of the mandala as an awakened being at the center of the universe, the center also represents the beginning of each person's journey toward knowledge, wisdom, and enlightenment. Often, mandalas are used as tools to focus the mind during meditation.<br>
                    
                    The mandala begins with the center, radiating out with symbols and designs as the pattern grows larger. It can be painted, drawn, or even made from colorful sand. Those painted on scrolls are often carried by travelers and pilgrims for a blessing on the road and used a focus for meditation as they journey.<br>
