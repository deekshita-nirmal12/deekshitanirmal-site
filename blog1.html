                <h1>Why .com is majorly used as domain ending</h1> 
                <img class="hero-img" src="images/hero4.jpg">
                <p>why do websites end in .com? Websites
                    with .com because it is one of the oldest and for sure the most recognizable domain extension in the whole world. .com stands for “commercial” and it was the first choice for those that started a business website in the early days of the internet.<br>.com means it stands for commercial and it was first introduced together with other top-level domain names such as .net,.edu,.gov,.mil,.org,.int. Back then it was more like an experiment since the internet was used mainly by educational, scientific organizations and government entities. <br>.com is synonymous with the web that is if people remember only a part of your domain then chances are that they will add a .com in the end and will assume that you have the .com version of your brand or your industry’s keywords. 
                Gradually it became the number 1 option for all kinds of business.<br>If you notice carefully most of the big brands use .com for their main site.Internet users are familiar with .com so they believe that websites with this domain extension are credible. If they see an alternative extension like insurance.xyzw (just an imaginary example) it will look spammy and not trusty to them.
                <br>There are more than 1500 domain extensions right now.
                You can also read the explanations for some other domain extensions below:
