                <p>
                    Divine places have divine energy.
                    Divine energy awakens the divinity within<br>
                    
                    Whenever I arrive at this magnificent village, I always feel a surge of divinity, positivity, and tranquility. This sort of experience is one that I’ve never had before, anywhere in this world.<br>
                    
                    I truly believe this is the only place that has offered me this level of tranquility and inner peace.
                    The experience in itself is indescribable; it can only be experienced, not explained.
                    
                    The atmosphere, the feelings, the sounds, the people, the climate, the very divine essence of this village — everything is unique and special.<br>
                    
                    For the past 250 years, this village has been blessed with the presence of the greatest souls in all of creation, and will continue to be blessed for thousands of years to come.
                    
                    Construction completed in 1916 (around 105 years ago), the mandir in Sarangpur was built in the most exhilarating of circumstances.<br>
                    
                    Today, it stands as a place of pilgrimage and great spiritual significance to not just me, but millions across the globe. It houses the second-highest temple in Gujarat, standing at exactly 108 feet (note the auspiciousness of 108 in Vedic tradition).
                    It is also the hub for new swamis (ordained monks) and sadhaks (training monks) of BAPS.
                    
                    Sarangpur is my ‘safe haven’. Situated 150km away from the metropolitan megacity of Ahmedabad, it is a must visit for one and all.<br>
                            
                    Vibrations can have a direct affect on us.
                    Sãrangpur has these vibrations.
                    I can’t wait to feel that energy again.
